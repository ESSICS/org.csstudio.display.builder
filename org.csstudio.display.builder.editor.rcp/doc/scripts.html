<h1>Scripts</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Ideally, a control system display can be created by
simply adding several widgets and configuring their
properties. In many cases, only the location, size
and PV name of a widget needs to be configured.
</p>

<p>There are cases, however, where the built-in
widget functionality is not sufficient.
Traditionally, this would be handled by developing a custom,
site-specific user interface tool.
The display builder script support often allows you
to avoid the creation of such a custom tool.
</p>


<h2>Basic Functionality</h2>

<p>Scripts are invoked from
</p>

<ul>
<li>PV changes</li>
<li>Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>The script always receives the <code>widget</code> which invoked it.
A script associated with PVs also receives the <code>pvs</code>
which might have triggered its invocation.
</p>


<h2>PV Scripts</h2>

<p>Example of invoking a script from PV changes:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Label widget</li>
<li>On its Scripts property, add a script by either specifying the path to the script,
    typically in a form relative to the location of the *.bob file,
    or enter the "embedded" script text.
</li>
<li>Add at least one PV. Enter its name, note that "Trigger" is by default selected.</li>
<li>You may add more PVs. Assert that at least one has the "Trigger" selected.</li>
</ol>

<p>At runtime, a connection is established to all PVs.
Whenever PVs marked as a "Trigger" change their value,
the script is invoked.
The script will receive a <code>widget</code> parameter
that holds the Label, and a <code>pvs</code> parameter
that holds a list of all PVs assigned to the script.
</p>

<p>A typical example is a script that reads the values of its PVs,
computes something, and uses the result to update one or more properties of the
widget:
</p>

<pre>
value = PVUtil.getDouble(pvs[0]);
if value >= 0:
    result = "Positive"
else:
    result = "Negative"
widget.setPropertyValue("text", result)
</pre>


<h2>Action Scripts</h2>

<p>Example of invoking a script from an Action:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an Action Button widget</li>
<li>On its Actions property, add an "Execute Script" action</li>
<li>Enter the path to the script, typically in a form relative to the location of the *.bob file,
    or enter the "embedded" script text.
</li>
</ol>

<p>At runtime, pushing the button will invoke the script.
The script receives a <code>widget</code> parameter
that holds the Action Button.
</p>

<p>A typical example is a script that performs some
action outside of the display tool,
then maybe displays the result in other widgets
which it locates based on their name:
</p>

<pre>
result = InvokeSomeCodeThatDoesSomething()

children = widget.getDisplayModel().runtimeChildren()
other = children.getChildByName("name_of_other_widget")

other.setPropertyValue("text", result)
</pre>


<h2>Jython Script</h2>

<p>Jython scripts are written in Python syntax, i.e. a very well designed, robust language.
They execute within the same Java instance that also executes the display builder
and have access to the complete API, including undocumented code.
</p>

<p>Any script file with a name that ends in ".py" which does not contain the word "python"
in its first line is executed as a Jython script.
In addition, the code of Jython scripts can be embedded in the *.bob file.
</p>

<p>As a downside, Jython scripts do not have access to the complete set of
native Python libraries, for example numpy.
</p>


<h2>Python Scripts</h2>

<p>Python scripts are executed by a native Python interpreter outside of the display builder.
They access key Display Builder API via networked proxies.
Python scripts have access to all native Python libraries, for example numpy.
</p>

<p>Any script file with a name that ends in ".py" which contains the word "python"
in its first line is executed as a Python script.
This is typically accomplished via the usual Python shebang
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python 
</pre>

<p>Python scripts must be in *.py files, they cannot be embedded in the *.bob file.
</p>

<p>As a downside, Python scripts incur some overhead at startup and whenever they
access the Display Builder API, because this is done via networked proxies.
They also depend on python being installed on the computer.
</p>


<h2>JavaScript Scripts</h2>

<p>Similar to Jython, JavaScript can be used as a language
with execution inside the Java instance that also runs the Display builder.
</p>

<p>Any script file with a name that ends in ".js" executed as JavaScript.
In addition, the JavaScript code can be embedded in the *.bob file.
</p>

<p>As a downside, JavaScript sucks as a language and will damage your brain.
</p>


<h2>Threading</h2>

<p>Each *.bob display has one script execution thread and one instance of the
Jython, Python and JavaScript support.
This allows scripts to run in the background without negatively impacting the user interface thread.
It also allows scripts for different *.bob displays to execute in parallel.
</p>

<p>
To limit the use of resources, however, at most <u>one</u> script executes for a given *.bob
display at a time.
Furthermore, if a specific script is triggered by either an action or a PV change,
further invocations of that same script are ignored until the current execution of the script finishes.
</p>
