# Named colors
# Whenever possible, use named colors
# instead of arbitrary red/green/blue values.

# Alarm colors (OK, MINOR, MAJOR, INVALID, DISCONNECTED)
# are predefined, but could be overridden in here

# Use alarm colors only when you mean to indicate an alarm.
# Avoid using 'Red' which might suggest an alarm
# just because you like the look of red.
# STOP looks similar to red=MAJOR alarm, and is allowed
# for 'STOP' type of buttons
STOP = 255,0,0

# Attention looks similar to a MINOR alarm.
# It is meant to draw attention
Attention = 255,160,0

# Colors for style
Background = 255, 255, 255
Header_Background=77,77,77
Header_ForeGround=255,255,255

# For widgets that write to PV.
Write_Background = 128, 255, 255

# Background for widgets that read PV

# The colors for On/Off, Open/Close etc,.
# "On" does not necessarily mean 'device is turned on', but
# stands for 'indicator is on, active, illuminated'.
# For a 'motor is at target' type indicator, the motor would
# actually be 'off' while the indicator uses the 'On' color.
#
# If one of the states represents an alarm, the corresponding alarm color may be used.
# For example, a limit switch indicator could use colors "Off" and "MAJOR":
# Off when idle, MAJOR when the limit switch was hit and this is an abnormal situation
# that requires attention.
On = 0,255,0
Off = 60,100,60
